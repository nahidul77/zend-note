//________________________________For loop_______________

/**
 * It is also legal to include more than one of each kind of for clause, separated by commas.
The termination-check will be considered to be true if any of its subclauses are true; it is like
an ‘or’ test. For example, the following statement:
 */
// for (
//     $x = 1, $y = 1, $z = 1; //initial expressions
//     $y < 10, $z < 10; // termination checks
//     $x = $x + 1, $y = $y + 2, // loop-end expressions
//     $z = $z + 3
// )
// print("$x, $y, $z \n");

/**
 * The exit() construct takes either a string or a number as argument, prints out the argument,
and then terminates execution of the script. die() is a alias of exit()
