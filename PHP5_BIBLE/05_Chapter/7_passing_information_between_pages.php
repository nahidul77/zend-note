/**
 * HTTP protocol itself is stateless. If you are a poetic soul, you might say that each HTTP request is on its own, with no direction home, like a complete unknown.
 * 
 * each HTTP request —
in most cases, this translates to each resource (HTML page, .jpg file,style sheet, and so on) being asked for and delivered — is independent of all the others, knows nothing substantive about the identity of the client, and has no memory.
